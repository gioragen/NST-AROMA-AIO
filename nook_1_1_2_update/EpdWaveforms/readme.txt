EpdWaveforms directory
======================

- Place new waveforms in this directory. Keep their names unchanged, for example:

                 V220_C017_60_TN0601_ED060SC7C1_BTC.wbf

- The contents of this directory will be copied into the intermediate zip file
  in the main build, from core/Makefile
